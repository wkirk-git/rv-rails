= rv-rails

Testing out the new rv package manager for ruby.
This uses it to install ruby in a slim debian container and install and run rails.

(I'm only testing this on my mbp so it is very apple silicon centric)

* Builds a slim debian trixie container
* Installs rv
* Sets up a not root rails user space
* rv installs ruby 3.4.7
* rv pins ruby 3.4.7
* gem installs rails
* Scaffolds a bare bones rails app to test functionality
* Starts rails at launch

== Usage

You can use the Makefile targets of build and run or manually with the docker commands below

```bash
make
make run
```

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t rv-rails .
```

Run
```bash
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 rv-rails
```
